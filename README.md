Energy Efficient Buildings Hub Simulation Platform
--------------------------------------------------
web software to support decision making in building retrofit projects


Objective
---------

The main objective of this EEB Hub Modeling and Simulation project is to develop and 
deploy a state-of-the-art modeling platform to the building industry in support of 
integrated design, construction, commissioning, and operation. A modeling platform 
can be viewed as a suite of interconnected tools that are strategically deployed to 
different stakeholders responsible for a building in different periods of its 
lifecycle. 
The idea is that empowered stakeholders will be able to make better informed decisions 
to reduce energy consumption in buildings. The interconnected aspect of tools in the 
platform should also facilitate negotiations among different stakeholders in the efforts 
to improve the overall building performance.

Software Stack
--------------

This simulation platform for buildings would not have been possible without the 
Open Source Software Community to which it is built upon:
*Bootstrap Styling
*Express Web Framework
*Node.js Server Side Language
*MongoDB Database
*Ubuntu Operating System
To contribute to this community, this code is released under an open source license
based off of the MIT License.

Form & Database Attributes
--------------------------

Attributes are based off of DOE's Building Energy Data Exchange Specification (BEDES).
BEDES provides a common data format for building characteristics, efficiency measures, 
and energy data definitions.  BEDES facilitates the utilization and sharing of empirical 
building energy performance data among software tools and data collection projects.
